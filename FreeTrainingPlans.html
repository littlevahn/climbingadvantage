            <h2>A Few Notes on How to Approach This Program</h2>
            <p>The weekly structure is designed as follows: <strong>2 days on, 1 day off, 2 days on, 2 days
                    off</strong>.<br>
                A schedule I like looks like this: <em>Train on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday</em>.<br>
                Of course, feel free to adjust the days to fit your personal schedule — consistency is what matters
                most.</p>

            <p><strong>Always, always, always warm up before each session.</strong><br>
                Your warm-up isn’t just about injury prevention — it sets the tone for your training.<br>
                Move slowly and with intention. Climb with precision and control.<br>
                Dial in your footwork. Be mindful of your hips.<br>
                The focus you bring to your warm-up will carry through your entire session.</p>
